## 5.2.1

* Fixed RxAudio.to_wav_bytes() to correctly handle Frame's signed 8-bit samples

## 5.2.0

* Fixed audio.lua to allow caller to specify desired sample rate and bit depth
* Changed default to audio recording to 8kHz, 8-bit (from 8kHz, 16-bit) due to bandwidth requirements

## 5.1.1

* Corrected new defaults for auto exposure algorithm to match firmware v25.080.0838 also in `camera.lua`

## 5.1.0

* Added `TxSpriteCoords` message for indicating the placement of a sprite at specified coordinates using a palette offset.

## 5.0.3

* Fixed Python version dependency issue - numpy 2.2.3 requires Python >= 3.10, updated project Python version minimum from 3.7 to 3.10.

## 5.0.2

* Docs: added ReadTheDocs API Reference and updated README

## 5.0.1

* Corrected new defaults for auto exposure algorithm to match firmware v25.080.0838

## 5.0.0

* Added support for `rgb_gain_limit` parameter to cap maximum per-channel gain for Frame camera

## 4.2.0

* Corrected `pyproject.toml` to include existing dependencies on `lz4`, `numpy`, `pillow`, `frame-ble`

## 4.1.0

* Updated camera exposure defaults. Added Rx classes for subscribing to auto exposure results and metering data.

## 4.0.0

* Allow multiple Rx classes to register for Frame data responses and specify their msg_code filter.

## 3.0.0

* Initial version of `FrameMsg` wrapper for FrameBle with added lifecycle and convenience functions for loading standard Lua helpers
* Reworked receive (Rx) handlers to attach and detach from the data response stream (only one Rx listener supported at the moment)
* Added `RxAudio` and `audio.lua` for handling streaming audio from Frame

## 2.2.0

* Added `RxTap` and the corresponding `tap.lua` library to receive taps and multi-taps from Frame

## 2.1.0

* Added support for lz4 compression of sprites and image sprite blocks
* Modified acknowledgement byte from data handler to return 0 for successful processing and 1 for error
* Set guidance in comments for photo capture resolution to 256-720 - low values for resolution near 100 cause issues with the subsequent photo capture

## 2.0.0

* Breaking: removed redundant `msg_code` attribute from Tx classes - pass the `msg_code` independently to `frame.send_message()`

## 1.0.1

* Fixed bug in image sprite block packing.
  TxSprite, TxImageSpriteBlock, RxPhoto available.

## 1.0.0

* First PyPI package release. TxSprite available, most Tx/Rx types unavailable.

## 0.1.0

* Initial version adapted from [the Flutter implementation](https://pub.dev/packages/frame_msg)
